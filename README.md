#Yelp API Script for Data Visualization

##Final Project for BANA 6037 - Data Visualization

Code adapted from https://gist.github.com/phillipjohnson/8889618
and the awesome blog Let's Talk Data: http://letstalkdata.com/2014/02/how-to-use-the-yelp-api-in-python/

##Notes
Make sure the hide directory has a __init__.py file (it can be empty)
	*This tells Python to treat the dir as a package, so we can import credentials with ```from hide import hide``` and call them with ```hide.variableName```
